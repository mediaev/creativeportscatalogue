Careful readers of this document may have noted that although it presents ten individual tools, collaborations between their producers feature throughout. Indeed, it’s been a great advantage to share insights and ideas between organisa- tions all striving for the same goal – to enable players in the cultural and creative industries to seek markets outside their locality.

These last words from the project don't mark the end; rather they should be seen as the start. In sharing the work behind the scenes, the Creative Ports partners make it possible for organisations around the world to use and improve on the work developed so far. Furthermore, a CCI Contact Desk has been installed as a bearer of knowledge created in the project and to act as a launchpad for future collaborations. Also, so-called Tandems will be formed to provide concrete internation- alisation support on a local and regional level. In Tandems, International networks/organisations, such as national cultural institutes, team up with local and regional business support organ- isations, public authorities and other CCI stake- holders. These clusters will set up joint events and a network to initiate and support the local CCI Internationalisation.

The documentation of the ten internationali- sation tools should be read in conjunction with the learning modules produced for each tool. Together they provide an understanding of the objectives, ideas, crafting and methodologies.
