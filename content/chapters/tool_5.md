## Idea and Organisation

ABCD Scanning Tool for CCI Internationalisation gathered intermediaries and cultural practitioners in online sessions to facilitate discussions in an open environment curated to create solutions and achieve synergies for and with the participants. The tool is an extension of previous successful tools developed by the organiser, [ARS BALTICA](https://www.ars-baltica.net/homepage).

The network ARS BALTICA supports the implementation of artistic/cultural projects with a strong focus on the Baltic Sea Region. It offers platforms for the exchange of knowledge and experience in the field of (cross-)cultural co-operation. Thus, it adds value to existing projects and co-operation models through active networking from a higher perspective.

ARS BALTICA advocates culture at other organisation’s meetings in the region to increase the significance of the cultural sector. It develops contacts and collaborations with other regional networks and strengthens regional cooperation. It promotes the Baltic Sea cultural life beyond the region by cooperating with leading European cultural organisations. ARS BALTICA also contributes to a joint Baltic Sea cultural policy.

## Aim and Target Group

The general aim of the ABCD Scanning Tool for CCI Internationalisation was to define the current needs for internationalisation within the CCI sector in each region of the Baltic Sea, to map and prioritise these needs by learning from each other and sharing ideas within the group of participants.

The goal was to communicate internationally by involving intermediary organisations and cultural practitioners from various Baltic Sea Region countries. It also provided a space for discussion in an open environment and created synergies for and with the participating partners.

More specifically, ABCD Scanning Tool for CCI Internationalisation aimed to collectively draft possible solutions in response to the expressed needs of the participants. The long-term aim is to create a sustainable format relevant for future action.


## The Program
The program consisted of two four-hour sessions repeated twice on the 1st and 3rd of March 2021 and then again on the 12th and 14th of April. The event was facilitated by Henryk Stawicki and Justyna Turek from Change Pilots and moderated by ARS BALTICA.

The program was divided into two parts. The first focused on key needs, the value expected, challenges, opportunities and trends, while the second part discussed potential practical solutions and actionable items. All participants received a brief for mapping the most urgent needs and expectations prior to the event.

## Communication

The invitation for ABCD Scanning Tool for CCI Internationalisation was first sent out to all Creative Ports partners. They were asked to forward the information to interested people from their networks. A Facebook event was created for each of the events, with regular reminder posts. Organisers sent a newsletter before each event with information for registration and the event goal and a review newsletter after the events. Cultural networks from the Baltic Sea Region and Muthesius University in Kiel were also asked to forward the information to their target groups.

## Lessons Learnt
From the perspective of the intermediary organisations, teamwork was important for understanding the point of view of various entities from the Baltic Sea Region and the possibility of increasing competencies in building internationalisation tools. The tool allowed the participating organisation to gain new skills and opened their eyes to the process of identifying barriers and benefits for CCI companies.
